# Epic 1: Core Prediction MVP

**Goal:** To deliver a functional, local-run application that allows a user to select a soccer match and risk level to receive a single, AI-generated betting prediction with a supporting rationale.

## Stories:

**1.1:** Project Foundation and Setup: Create a basic local folder structure with runnable "Hello World" starter applications for both the frontend and backend.

**1.2:** Fetch and Display Matches: Implement the backend endpoint and frontend UI to display a selectable list of upcoming soccer matches from a free sports API.

**1.3:** User Selection and Request: Implement the UI for a user to select a match, choose a risk level, and trigger the prediction request, showing a loading state.

**1.4:** AI Prediction Engine: Implement the backend endpoint that receives the request, performs the AI analysis of web data, and returns a bet suggestion and rationale.

**1.5:** Display Prediction Result: Implement the UI to display the final prediction and rationale received from the backend and allow the user to restart the process.
