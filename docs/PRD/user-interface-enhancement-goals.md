# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

The primary goal is to create a more "familiar" and cohesive user experience. The project currently uses a mix of styled-components and tailwindcss. To reduce technical debt and ensure consistency, all new development for this enhancement will standardize on Tailwind CSS for layout and component styling. Global theme variables (colors, fonts, spacing for light/dark modes) will be defined in a central location (src/styles/theme.js) and consumed by Tailwind's configuration, ensuring a single source of truth for all styling.

## Modified/New Screens and Views

**Modified - Home Page:** The layout will be updated to feel less "naked." This may include adding container elements, a clearer grid structure, and potentially sections for featured matches or user-specific content. It will be the primary showcase for the new "cozy" theme.

**Modified - Match Details Page:** This page will be updated to adopt the new global theme for full consistency with the rest of the application.

**New - Dashboard Page:** A new page will be created to serve as the user's main hub.

## UI Consistency Requirements

All new and modified components MUST use the centralized theme variables for colors, fonts, and spacing to ensure the light/dark mode switch works globally.

While the aesthetic will be updated, the core interaction patterns (e.g., clicking a match card to see details) should remain intuitive and consistent with user expectations.

The application must maintain its responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
