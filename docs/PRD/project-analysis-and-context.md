# Project Analysis and Context

**Analysis Source:** A document-project task was performed, and the output is now stored in docs/brownfield-architecture.md.

**Current Project State:** The project is a client-side React SPA that functions as an AI-powered sports betting advisor. It currently fetches a limited number of matches from the SportsDB API and allows users to select a match and risk level to get a prediction.

**Enhancement Type:** This work involves a New Feature Addition (Dashboard), a Major Feature Modification (AI integration improvements, full match list), and a UI/UX Overhaul ("cozy" feel, light/dark mode).

**Impact Assessment:** The scope of these changes represents a Significant Impact, as it will involve creating new core views (Dashboard), implementing a site-wide theming system, and overhauling the core data-fetching logic.
