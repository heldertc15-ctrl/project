# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Overhaul the UI/UX to create a more "cozy" and familiar user experience.

Implement a user-selectable light and dark mode across the application.

Introduce a new Dashboard view.

Correct the core data-fetching logic to display all available soccer matches from the SportsDB API.

Improve the integration and functionality of the AI-powered betting advisor.

## Background Context

The current application serves as a functional proof-of-concept for an AI-powered sports betting advisor. However, its user experience is minimal, feeling "naked" and lacking user-friendly features. Furthermore, a critical bug in its data-fetching logic prevents it from displaying a full list of matches, limiting its core utility.

This enhancement aims to evolve the application into a more robust and engaging tool by fixing the data-fetching issue, introducing a new personalized dashboard, and implementing modern UI features like a light/dark mode to create a more comfortable and "familiar" user experience.
