# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Create a functional, local-run prototype to validate the core AI's ability to generate optimal, risk-adjusted betting suggestions for soccer matches.

The AI's predictions must be demonstrably more accurate than random chance to provide real value.

Empower beginner bettors with a simple, data-driven tool that increases their confidence and improves their success rate.

## Background Context

This project addresses a gap in the sports betting market for the "cautious newcomer." These users are interested in betting but are often deterred by the complexity of data analysis or the opacity of paid tipster services. This application will serve as a trusted advisor, translating complex, real-time web data into a single, actionable betting suggestion with a clear rationale. The MVP is a local-run application focused entirely on proving the viability of this core AI-driven feature.
