# Requirements

## Functional

**FR1:** The system shall fetch and display all available soccer matches from the SportsDB API, removing the current limitation of only showing three.

**FR2:** The application must include a new, distinct Dashboard page accessible from the main navigation.

**FR3:** A theme-switching mechanism (e.g., a toggle button) shall be implemented that allows users to select between a Light Mode and a Dark Mode. The chosen theme must persist for the user across sessions.

**FR4:** The AI betting advisor's integration point shall be reviewed and prepared for future enhancements.

## Non-Functional

**NFR1:** The overall UI design shall be updated to feel more "familiar" and less "naked," using common layout patterns and providing a richer visual experience.

**NFR2:** The application must maintain a responsive layout, ensuring usability on common desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

**NFR3:** The implementation of new features should not negatively impact the existing application's load time or performance.

**NFR4:** The styling for new components must be consistent with the chosen primary styling system (either Tailwind CSS or Styled Components) to reduce technical debt.
