# Existing Project Analysis

Current Project State: The project is a client-side React SPA built with Create React App. It functions as an AI sports betting advisor by fetching data from the SportsDB API.

Available Documentation: The primary source of truth for the existing system is the docs/brownfield-architecture.md document generated during the initial analysis phase.

Identified Constraints: The architecture must respect the existing React framework. A key consideration is resolving the inconsistent use of both styled-components and tailwindcss.
