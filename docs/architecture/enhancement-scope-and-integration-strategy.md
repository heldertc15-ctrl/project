# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview

Enhancement Type: New Feature Addition (Dashboard), Major Feature Modification (API fix, AI improvements), and UI/UX Overhaul ("cozy" feel, light/dark mode).

Scope: To implement a "cozy" and familiar UI with a persistent light/dark mode, add a new Dashboard page, and correct the core data-fetching logic to retrieve all available soccer matches.

Integration Impact: Significant. The changes will affect global styling, core data handling, and application routing.

## Integration Approach

Code Integration Strategy: The enhancement will be integrated by creating new components (Dashboard.js), new hooks (useTheme.js), and modifying existing components. We will standardize on Tailwind CSS for all new and modified component styling to resolve the inconsistency noted in the "As-Is" analysis.

API Integration: The fix for data fetching will be made in the existing client-side API call logic within the Home.js page. For the future AI enhancements, a new service module (src/services/aiService.js) will be created to encapsulate this logic, allowing for easier future migration to a dedicated backend if needed.

UI Integration: The new Dashboard will be registered as a new route in src/App.js. The theme-switching component will be integrated directly into the existing src/components/Navbar.js.

## Compatibility Requirements

Existing API Compatibility: This enhancement requires no changes to external API contracts; it only alters how the client fetches data.

Database Schema Compatibility: Not applicable (client-side application).

UI/UX Consistency: The core user flow of selecting a match from the home page to view details must remain intact and functional. All new UI elements must adhere to the new centralized theming system.

Performance Impact: Fetching all matches may increase initial load time. The implementation must include a clear loading state to manage user perception. Further optimization (like virtualization or pagination) can be considered a future enhancement if initial performance is not acceptable.
