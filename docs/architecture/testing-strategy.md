# Testing Strategy

## Integration with Existing Tests

Existing Test Framework: The project has React Testing Library installed and ready for use.

Test Organization: There are currently no test files in the project. We will establish a new convention of creating *.test.js files alongside their corresponding component files (e.g., Navbar.test.js next to Navbar.js).

Coverage Requirements: The current test coverage is 0%.

## New Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests for New Components

Framework: React Testing Library.

Location: Test files will be co-located with the component files.

Coverage Target: All new code, including hooks and components, should aim for a minimum of 80% unit test coverage.

Integration with Existing: A test script will be added to package.json to execute all new tests as part of the development workflow.

### Integration Tests

Scope: Integration tests will focus on verifying interactions between components. For example, testing that clicking the ThemeSwitcher component correctly applies the new theme to the DashboardPage.

New Feature Testing: We will test that the new /dashboard route renders the DashboardPage component correctly.

## Regression Testing

Existing Feature Verification: The primary goal of regression testing is to ensure existing functionality is not broken by the enhancement.

Automated Regression Suite: The new unit and integration tests will serve as our initial automated regression suite.

Manual Testing Requirements: Before completing the project, a manual check will be performed to verify:

The home page successfully loads all matches from the API.

The existing search functionality still filters the full list of matches correctly.

Users can still navigate from the home page to the match details page.
