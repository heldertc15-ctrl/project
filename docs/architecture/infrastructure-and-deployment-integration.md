# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

## Existing Infrastructure

Current Deployment: No automated deployment process is defined in the repository. It is assumed to be a manual deployment of the static build (npm run build) to a hosting provider.

Infrastructure Tools: None identified.

Environments: No distinct development, staging, or production environments are formally defined in the project.

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy

Deployment Approach: The enhancement will follow the existing manual deployment process. The developer will run npm run build to create an updated production build and then manually upload the contents of the /build directory to the hosting service.

Infrastructure Changes: No new infrastructure is required for the UI and data-fetching enhancements. Note: If the AI Advisor feature evolves into a backend service, it will require new infrastructure (e.g., a server or serverless functions), which would need to be planned separately.

Pipeline Integration: Not applicable, as no CI/CD pipeline currently exists.

## Rollback Strategy

Rollback Method: Rollback will be a manual process. It requires redeploying the previously saved build directory to the hosting provider. It is critical to save the last working build artifact before deploying a new version.

Risk Mitigation: The initial release of the Dashboard page can be managed via a feature flag in the code to easily hide it from the Navbar if any issues arise.

Monitoring: No existing monitoring tools have been identified.
