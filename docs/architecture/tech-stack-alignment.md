# Tech Stack Alignment

The development of this enhancement will leverage the existing technology stack to ensure seamless integration and maintainability.

## Existing Technology Stack

The following table outlines the current technologies and their role in the enhancement work.

Category	Current Technology	Version	Usage in Enhancement	Notes
Framework	React	18.2.0	All new components and pages will be built using React.	Core library remains unchanged.
Routing	React Router DOM	6.22.3	Will be used to add the new /dashboard route.	No changes to the library itself.
Styling	Tailwind CSS	3.4.1	This will be the standard styling method for all new and modified components.	To be configured for the new theming system.
Styling	Styled Components	6.1.8	Existing components using this will be maintained. No new components should use this method.	We will not add new Styled Components to avoid increasing technical debt.
Testing	Testing Library	13.4.0	Will be used to write unit tests for all new components and logic.	The goal is to introduce tests where none existed.

## New Technology Additions

At this stage, no new major libraries or frameworks are proposed. The theme-switching functionality can be built using React's native Context API, and the data-fetching fix is a logic change. This approach minimizes new dependencies, which is a best practice for brownfield enhancements.
