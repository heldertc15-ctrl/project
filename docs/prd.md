A I Soccer Betting Advisor: Product Requirements Document (PRD) v1.0

1\. Goals and Background Context

Goals



Create a functional, local-run prototype to validate the core AI's ability to generate optimal, risk-adjusted betting suggestions for soccer matches.



The AI's predictions must be demonstrably more accurate than random chance to provide real value.



Empower beginner bettors with a simple, data-driven tool that increases their confidence and improves their success rate.



Background Context

This project addresses a gap in the sports betting market for the "cautious newcomer." These users are interested in betting but are often deterred by the complexity of data analysis or the opacity of paid tipster services. This application will serve as a trusted advisor, translating complex, real-time web data into a single, actionable betting suggestion with a clear rationale. The MVP is a local-run application focused entirely on proving the viability of this core AI-driven feature.

2\. Requirements

Functional Requirements



FR1: The system must fetch a list of upcoming soccer matches from a free sports API.



FR2: The system must display the list of matches to the user, allowing them to select one.



FR3: After a match is selected, the system must present the user with three risk level options: Low, Medium, and High.



FR4: Upon user selection of a match and a risk level, the system must initiate an AI analysis process.



FR5: The AI engine must analyze publicly available web data to determine an optimal bet type for the given match and risk profile.



FR6: The AI engine must generate a concise, single-sentence rationale explaining its betting suggestion.



FR7: The system must display the final bet suggestion and its rationale to the user.



Non-Functional Requirements



NFR1: The entire application must be able to run on a user's local machine.



NFR2: The AI analysis process should complete and display results in under 15 seconds.



NFR3: The user interface must be intuitive and designed for beginners.



NFR4: All technologies and APIs used must be free of charge for the prototype.



3\. User Interface Design Goals

Overall UX Vision

The UX vision is to create an uncluttered, single-purpose interface that guides the beginner user through the process effortlessly, prioritizing clarity and building user trust.



Key Interaction Paradigms

The primary interaction is a three-step linear workflow: 1. Select Match -> 2. Select Risk -> 3. Receive Prediction.



Core Screens and Views



Match Selection View



Risk Selection View



Prediction Display View



4\. Technical Assumptions

Repository Structure: Monorepo

Service Architecture: The backend will be a single, monolithic service.Testing Requirements: Unit Tests Only for the MVP.Backend Technology: Python

Frontend Technology: JavaScript library (e.g., React)

API Style: Local REST API



5\. Epic 1: Core Prediction MVP

Goal: To deliver a functional, local-run application that allows a user to select a soccer match and risk level to receive a single, AI-generated betting prediction with a supporting rationale.



Stories:



1.1: Project Foundation and Setup: Create a basic local folder structure with runnable "Hello World" starter applications for both the frontend and backend.



1.2: Fetch and Display Matches: Implement the backend endpoint and frontend UI to display a selectable list of upcoming soccer matches from a free sports API.



1.3: User Selection and Request: Implement the UI for a user to select a match, choose a risk level, and trigger the prediction request, showing a loading state.



1.4: AI Prediction Engine: Implement the backend endpoint that receives the request, performs the AI analysis of web data, and returns a bet suggestion and rationale.



1.5: Display Prediction Result: Implement the UI to display the final prediction and rationale received from the backend and allow the user to restart the process.
