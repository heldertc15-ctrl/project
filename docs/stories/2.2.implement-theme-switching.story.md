# Story 2.2: Implement Theme Switching

## Status
Done
## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to be able to switch between light and dark modes,
**so that** I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A theme-switching toggle/button is present in the Navbar.
2. Clicking the toggle switches the entire application's color scheme between the defined light and dark themes.
3. The user's theme preference is saved and persists across browser sessions (e.g., using localStorage).
4. All interactive elements (buttons, links, search bars) are styled correctly and legibly in both modes.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1 successfully established:
- Complete theming foundation with useTheme hook in `src/hooks/useTheme.tsx`
- Theme configurations for both light and dark modes with comprehensive color, font, and spacing variables
- localStorage persistence with error handling already implemented
- Tailwind CSS configuration updated to support CSS variables for theming
- All existing components (App.tsx, MatchSelector.tsx) refactored to use theme variables
- 48 tests passing including 13 new tests for useTheme hook functionality
- Default light mode setting verified and working

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
**Current Technology Stack:**
- Framework: React 18.2.0 - ThemeSwitcher component will be built using React
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 - This will be the standard styling method for the new ThemeSwitcher component
- Styling: Styled Components 6.1.8 - Existing components using this will be maintained, no new components should use this method
- Testing: Testing Library 13.4.0 - Will be used to write unit tests for the new ThemeSwitcher component

**Integration Strategy:**
- Theme-switching functionality will use the existing useTheme hook from story 2.1
- No new major libraries or frameworks required

### Source Tree Integration
[Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md]
**File Organization for Theme Switching:**
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ThemeSwitcher.tsx   # (+) New component for light/dark mode toggle
│   └── Navbar.tsx          # (+) New application header component
├── hooks/
│   └── useTheme.tsx        # (existing) Hook to manage theme state - already implemented
└── (existing structure)
```

**Integration Guidelines:**
- File Naming: Components follow PascalCase.tsx convention for TypeScript
- Folder Organization: Components will be placed in `src/components/`
- Import/Export Patterns: Use absolute paths from src directory where possible

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]
**Component Specifications:**

**ThemeSwitcher Component:**
- Responsibility: A UI component (likely a button or toggle switch) that allows the user to change the theme. It will use the useTheme hook to perform this action
- Integration Points: This component will be placed inside the new `src/components/Navbar.tsx` component
- Technology Stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Dependency: Will consume the useTheme hook already implemented in story 2.1

**Navbar Component:**
- Responsibility: Application header/navigation bar that houses the ThemeSwitcher and provides consistent navigation
- Integration Points: Will be integrated into App.tsx as the main application header
- Technology Stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Content: Application title/branding and ThemeSwitcher component

**Component Interaction:**
- ThemeSwitcher calls useTheme hook to toggle theme state
- useTheme hook manages theme persistence and state changes
- Theme changes apply globally to all styled components

### Coding Standards and Integration Rules
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md]
**Critical Integration Rules:**
- Styling Consistency: ThemeSwitcher component MUST be styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes. Do not introduce any new styled-components
- Error Handling: Component should handle any theme switching errors gracefully
- Code Style: Adhere to default Create React App ESLint rules for all new code

**Component Testing Requirements:**
- ThemeSwitcher component must have corresponding *.test.tsx file
- Navbar component must have corresponding *.test.tsx file
- Tests written using React Testing Library to verify correct rendering and interactions
- Co-locate test files with component files

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Testing Framework and Location:**
- Framework: React Testing Library
- Location: Test files co-located with component files
- Coverage Target: Aim for minimum 80% unit test coverage for new code

**Required Test Categories for Theme Switching:**
- Unit tests for ThemeSwitcher component (button rendering, click handling)
- Integration tests for theme switching functionality with useTheme hook
- Regression tests to ensure existing functionality not broken by Navbar changes

**Test File Locations:**
- `src/components/ThemeSwitcher.test.tsx` - Unit tests for ThemeSwitcher component
- `src/components/Navbar.test.tsx` - Unit tests for Navbar component and ThemeSwitcher integration

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing useTheme hook from story 2.1 - do not create new theme management
- Must not interfere with existing App.tsx functionality when adding Navbar
- Must maintain accessibility standards for theme toggle controls
- Theme switching must be instant with no loading states
- All existing theme variables from story 2.1 must be leveraged

### Data Models
No specific data models required - ThemeSwitcher will use existing theme interfaces from useTheme hook:
```typescript
interface UseThemeReturn {
  theme: Theme;
  toggleTheme: () => void;
  setTheme: (mode: 'light' | 'dark') => void;
}
```

### Project Structure Alignment
The ThemeSwitcher component aligns with the existing project structure:
- Uses established `src/components/` structure
- Follows TypeScript patterns from existing components
- Maintains Tailwind CSS styling approach
- Integrates with existing React component architecture

## Testing

### Testing Framework and Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Framework**: React Testing Library with Jest
- **Location**: Test files co-located with component files in `src/components/`
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% unit test coverage for new code
- **Naming Convention**: Component tests use `.test.tsx` extension

### Required Test Categories
1. **ThemeSwitcher Component Tests** (`src/components/ThemeSwitcher.test.tsx`)
   - Render test: Component renders without crashing
   - Toggle functionality: Click event triggers theme switch
   - useTheme integration: Correctly consumes and calls useTheme hook
   - Accessibility: ARIA attributes are present and correct
   - Visual states: Component displays correct icon/text for current theme

2. **Navbar Component Tests** (`src/components/Navbar.test.tsx`)
   - Render test: Component renders without crashing
   - Layout test: Contains application title and ThemeSwitcher
   - Responsive behavior: Maintains layout across different screen sizes
   - Theme awareness: Applies correct theme styling

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Theme switching propagates to entire application
   - Navbar integration with App.tsx maintains existing functionality
   - No regression in existing MatchSelector or other components

### Test Implementation Requirements
- Use `render` from @testing-library/react with ThemeProvider wrapper
- Use `fireEvent.click` or `userEvent.click` for interaction testing
- Use `screen.getByRole`, `screen.getByLabelText` for accessibility-focused queries
- Mock the useTheme hook when testing components in isolation
- Verify theme changes with `expect(document.documentElement).toHaveAttribute('data-theme', 'dark')`
