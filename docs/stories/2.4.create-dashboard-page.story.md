## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.3 successfully corrected API data fetching to show all available matches with comprehensive error handling and maintained excellent performance with large datasets. Stories 2.1 and 2.2 established a robust theming system with light/dark modes that should be fully integrated into the new Dashboard page.

### CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DISCREPANCY
**IMPORTANT:** The architecture documents specify React Router DOM 6.22.3 for routing, but the current application does NOT have React Router installed and uses a single-page workflow approach. This story requires:
1. Adding React Router DOM as a dependency
2. Refactoring the existing single-page workflow to support multiple routes
3. Maintaining backward compatibility with existing prediction workflow

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
**Current Technology Stack:**
- Framework: React 18.2.0 - Will be used for Dashboard component
- Routing: React Router DOM 6.22.3 - **NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED** (currently missing)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.3.3 - Will be used for all Dashboard styling
- Testing: React Testing Library 16.3.0 - Will be used for Dashboard component tests

**Integration Strategy:**
- Install React Router DOM and configure routing infrastructure
- Maintain existing single-page prediction workflow within routed structure
- Use existing theming system (useTheme hook) for consistent styling

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]
**DashboardPage Component:**
- **Responsibility:** A new page component that will serve as the main dashboard with placeholder sections
- **Integration Points:** Added as a new route in the main router within src/App.tsx
- **Technology Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Layout:** Use Container component for consistent page layout, Card components for placeholder sections

**useTheme Hook Integration:**
- Dashboard component must consume useTheme hook for theme-aware styling
- All components must be styled for both light and dark themes
- Maintain consistency with existing ThemeSwitcher functionality

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md]
**New Files to Create:**
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard page component
- `src/pages/Dashboard.test.tsx` - Unit tests for dashboard component

**Files to Modify:**
- `apps/frontend/package.json` - Add react-router-dom dependency
- `src/App.tsx` - Add routing configuration and maintain existing workflow
- `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Add Dashboard link navigation

**Project Structure Notes:**
The src/pages/ directory does not exist and needs to be created. Current structure has:
- ✅ src/components/ (existing with Navbar.tsx, ThemeSwitcher.tsx)
- ✅ src/hooks/ (existing with useTheme.tsx)
- ✅ src/features/ (existing with prediction/MatchSelector.tsx)
- ✅ src/services/ (existing with apiClient.ts)
- ❌ src/pages/ (needs to be created)

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]
**No API changes required** for this story. Dashboard will be a static page with placeholder content. Future stories may add API integration for dashboard data.

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md]
- **Styling Consistency:** All new components MUST be styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Component Testing:** Dashboard component must have corresponding *.test.tsx file
- **Error Handling:** Not applicable for static dashboard page
- **Logging:** Use console.error for any errors, remove console.log before completion

### Routing Architecture Requirements
**Current State:** Single-page application with workflow steps ('selection' | 'loading' | 'result' | 'error')
**Required State:** Multi-page application with routes:
- `/` - Home page (existing prediction workflow)
- `/dashboard` - New dashboard page

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Install React Router DOM
2. Wrap existing App component with Router
3. Create route configuration
4. Maintain existing prediction workflow on home route
5. Add new dashboard route

### Theming Integration
[Source: Previous stories 2.1, 2.2]
The application has a fully functional theming system:
- useTheme hook provides theme state and toggle functionality
- ThemeSwitcher component in Navbar
- theme.mode values: 'light' | 'dark'
- document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme.mode) for global theming

Dashboard component must:
- Import and use useTheme hook
- Apply theme-aware Tailwind classes
- Support both light and dark modes seamlessly

### Project Structure Alignment
**Current Project Structure (apps/frontend/src/):**
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar.tsx (will be modified)
│   └── ThemeSwitcher.tsx
├── features/
│   └── prediction/
│       └── MatchSelector.tsx

├── services/
│   └── apiClient.ts
├── test/
│   └── setup.ts
├── App.tsx (will be modified for routing)
├── index.css
└── main.tsx
```

**Required Structure After Implementation:**
```
src/
├── components/
├── features/
├── hooks/
├── pages/              # NEW DIRECTORY
│   └── Dashboard.tsx   # NEW FILE

```

## Testing

### Testing Framework and Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Framework**: React Testing Library with Vitest (not Jest - project uses Vitest as test runner)
- **Test Runner**: Vitest 0.34.4 as configured in package.json
- **Testing DOM**: jsdom 26.1.0 for DOM simulation
- **Location**: Test files co-located with component files (Dashboard.test.tsx)
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% unit test coverage for new Dashboard component
- **Test Organization**: *.test.tsx files alongside component files

### Required Test Categories
1. **Dashboard Component Tests** (`src/pages/Dashboard.test.tsx`)
   - Test component renders correctly
   - Test placeholder sections are displayed
   - Test responsive layout behavior

2. **Theme Integration Tests**
   - Test Dashboard component with light theme
   - Test Dashboard component with dark theme
   - Test theme switching functionality on Dashboard page
   - Verify theme-aware Tailwind classes are applied correctly

3. **Routing Tests** (in `src/App.test.tsx`)
   - Test /dashboard route renders Dashboard component
   - Test navigation from home to dashboard
   - Test navbar Dashboard link functionality
   - Test URL changes correctly when navigating

4. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end navigation workflow (home → dashboard → home)
   - Test that existing prediction workflow continues to work after routing changes
   - Test theme persistence across page navigation

### Test Implementation Requirements
- Mock React Router DOM for isolated component testing (using Vitest mocking capabilities)
- Test both light and dark theme variations
- Verify dashboard placeholder content displays correctly
- Ensure existing functionality is not broken by routing addition
- Test responsive design across different screen sizes
- Use Vitest's `vi.mock()` for mocking dependencies (not Jest mocks)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** ✓

The implementation demonstrates high-quality, production-ready code with comprehensive test coverage (83 tests passing) and excellent architectural design. The developer successfully transformed a single-page application into a multi-page routed architecture while maintaining backward compatibility and implementing a sophisticated theming system.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Architectural Excellence**: Clean separation of concerns with proper page extraction (Home.tsx) and routing implementation
- **Theme Consistency**: Robust theming system using CSS variables for light/dark mode support
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 12 detailed Dashboard component tests covering functionality, responsiveness, and accessibility
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper grid layouts and navigation patterns
- **Code Organization**: Proper file structure following established project conventions

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Change**: Standardized theme classes from mixed theme-* and var(--color-*) to consistent CSS variable usage
- **Why**: Ensures consistent theming approach across the application and better maintainability
- **How**: Replaced all theme-* classes with bg-[var(--color-*)] format for uniform styling approach

**File**: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

- **Why**: Theme management is already handled at the application level in App.tsx, making component-level theme effects unnecessary
- **How**: Removed useEffect import and theme management logic, reducing component complexity

**File**: `src/pages/Home.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed console.log statement from handleMatchSelect function
- **Why**: Compliance with coding standards requiring removal of console.log statements before completion
- **How**: Cleaned up debugging code while maintaining functional behavior

**File**: `src/pages/Dashboard.test.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated theme testing to match refactored CSS variable approach
- **Why**: Ensure tests accurately reflect the standardized theming implementation
- **How**: Modified test assertion to check for bg-[var(--color-background)] instead of bg-theme-background

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Follows Tailwind CSS utility classes, proper error handling, API logic encapsulation
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Correct file locations, proper directory structure with src/pages/ creation
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with React Testing Library, 83 tests passing
