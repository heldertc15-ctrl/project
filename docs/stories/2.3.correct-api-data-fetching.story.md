# Story 2.3: Correct API Data Fetching

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see all available soccer matches,
**so that** I can get a complete overview of all betting opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The data-fetching logic on the Home page is modified to retrieve all matches from the SportsDB API instead of a limited number.
2. The Home page correctly displays the full list of matches returned by the API.
3. The application handles the loading state gracefully while the full list of matches is being fetched.
4. Existing functionality, such as searching and navigating to match details, continues to work correctly with the full list.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.2 successfully implemented theme switching with comprehensive UI theming. No regressions should occur with API changes, but testing should verify that theme switching continues to work correctly with the updated match data flow.

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
**Current Technology Stack:**
- Framework: React 18.2.0 - No changes needed to React components
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 - Existing UI styling will handle larger datasets
- Backend: Python with httpx for HTTP requests - Will use existing HTTP client for SportsDB API calls
- Testing: Testing Library 13.4.0 - Will be used to test updated API functionality

**Integration Strategy:**
- No new major libraries or frameworks required
- Use existing httpx client for API calls
- Leverage existing error handling patterns

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md, data-models-and-schema-changes.md]
**Current API Endpoint:** `GET /prediction/matches`
**Backend Service Location:** `apps/backend/app/services/match_service.py`

**Match Interface (already defined):**
```typescript
interface Match {
  id: string;
  homeTeam: string;
  awayTeam: string;
  startTime: string; // ISO 8601 format
}
```

**SportsDB API Details:**
- Base URL: `https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/3`
- Endpoint: `/eventsnextleague.php?id={premier_league_id}`
- Premier League ID: `4328`
- Current limitation: Code limits to 10 matches (`[:10]` slice)
- Required change: Remove the limit to fetch all available matches

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md]
**Backend Files to Modify:**
- `apps/backend/app/services/match_service.py` - Remove hardcoded data, enable real API, remove match limit

**Frontend Files (existing, no changes needed):**
- `apps/frontend/src/services/apiClient.ts` - API client interface (no changes required)
- `apps/frontend/src/features/prediction/MatchSelector.tsx` - Match display component (should handle larger datasets)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md]
- **Error Handling:** All external API calls must include try/catch blocks to handle network errors gracefully
- **API Logic Encapsulation:** The logic for fetching data from the external SportsDB API must be encapsulated in a dedicated service (already done in MatchService)
- **Logging:** Use console.error for logging caught errors, remove console.log before completion

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Framework:** React Testing Library for frontend, pytest for backend
**Coverage Target:** Minimum 80% unit test coverage for modified code
**Test Categories:**
- Backend service tests for API integration
- Frontend component tests with larger datasets
- Integration tests for end-to-end data flow
- Error handling tests for API failures

### Data Flow Analysis
**Current Flow:**
1. Frontend MatchSelector calls `apiClient.getMatches()`
2. API client calls `GET /prediction/matches` on backend
3. Backend MatchService returns 3 hardcoded matches
4. Frontend displays limited match list

**Required Flow:**
1. Frontend MatchSelector calls `apiClient.getMatches()` (no change)
2. API client calls `GET /prediction/matches` on backend (no change)
3. Backend MatchService fetches ALL matches from SportsDB API
4. Frontend displays complete match list with proper loading/error handling

### Performance Considerations
- SportsDB API may return significantly more matches than current 3 hardcoded entries
- Frontend MatchSelector should handle rendering larger lists efficiently
- Consider pagination or virtual scrolling if match count becomes very large (monitor performance)
- API response times may be longer for full dataset vs limited dataset

### Project Structure Alignment
The required changes align perfectly with existing project structure:
- Backend service pattern already established in `match_service.py`
- Frontend API client pattern already implemented
- Error handling patterns already in place
- Testing structure supports the required test additions
