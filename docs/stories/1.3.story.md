# Story 1.3: User Selection and Request

## Status
Done
## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to select a match, choose a risk level, and trigger the prediction request with a loading state,
**so that** I can get an AI-generated betting prediction for my chosen match and risk preference.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can select a match from the available matches list (from story 1.2)
2. User can choose from three risk levels: Low, Medium, High
3. User can trigger the prediction request by clicking a "Get Prediction" button
4. The application shows a loading state while the prediction request is being processed
5. The prediction request is sent to the backend `/predict` endpoint with matchId and riskLevel
6. User interface prevents multiple simultaneous prediction requests

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Enhance MatchSelector component to support risk level selection (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Add risk level selection UI (radio buttons or dropdown)
  - [x] Add "Get Prediction" button that becomes enabled when both match and risk are selected
  - [x] Implement form validation to ensure both match and risk level are selected
- [x] Implement prediction request functionality (AC: 3, 5, 6)
  - [x] Update `apps/frontend/src/services/apiClient.ts` with `/predict` POST method
  - [x] Create prediction request handler in MatchSelector component
  - [x] Add request state management to prevent duplicate requests

  - [x] Add loading state to component state management
  - [x] Display loading spinner/message during prediction request
  - [x] Disable form interactions while request is in progress
- [x] Update App.tsx to handle prediction workflow state (AC: 1-6)
  - [x] Add state management for current workflow step (match selection vs. loading vs. result)
  - [x] Pass prediction request handler down to MatchSelector
  - [x] Handle prediction response and error states
- [x] Unit testing based on Testing Strategy
  - [x] Write tests for risk level selection functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 delivered:
- Working MatchSelector component with match selection functionality
- Established apiClient.ts for HTTP communication with backend
- React state management patterns using useState hooks
- Clean Tailwind CSS styling for match display
- Comprehensive testing setup for both frontend and backend

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**PredictionRequest Interface (TypeScript):**
```typescript
interface PredictionRequest {
  matchId: string;
  riskLevel: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High';
}
```

**Match Interface (existing):**
```typescript
interface Match {
  id: string;
  homeTeam: string;
  awayTeam: string;
  startTime: string; // ISO 8601 format
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
**POST /predict endpoint:**
- URL: `http://localhost:8000/predict`
- Method: POST
- Content-Type: application/json
- Request Body: PredictionRequest object
- Response: PredictionResult object (status 200)

**PredictionRequest Schema:**
- matchId: string (matches selected match.id)
- riskLevel: string enum ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/components.md]
**Match Selector View:** "Fetches and displays matches, handles user selection of match and risk."

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Frontend Structure:**
- Continue using `src/features/prediction/MatchSelector.tsx` for enhanced functionality
- `src/services/apiClient.ts` needs new `predict` method
- State management using React's built-in useState hook
- Single page conditional rendering (no routing needed)

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**Frontend Files to Modify:**
- `apps/frontend/src/features/prediction/MatchSelector.tsx` - Add risk selection and prediction request
- `apps/frontend/src/services/apiClient.ts` - Add predict method
- `apps/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Update workflow state management

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Use React's built-in useState for state management
- Single page app with conditional rendering (no routing library)
- Component organization follows feature-based structure

### Core Workflow Context
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
Sequence for this story:
1. User selects match (from previous story)
2. User selects risk level (new functionality)
3. User clicks "Get Prediction" button (new functionality)
4. Frontend → Backend: POST /predict (with matchId, riskLevel)
5. Frontend shows loading state while waiting for response
6. Backend processes prediction (handled in story 1.4)
7. Frontend receives prediction result (handled in story 1.5)

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths align with unified project structure. This story builds upon existing MatchSelector component, maintaining consistency with established patterns.

### Testing
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Testing Frameworks:**
- Frontend: Vitest ~0.34.4 (native testing framework for Vite)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for enhanced MatchSelector.tsx (risk selection, prediction request)
- Unit tests for updated apiClient.ts (predict method)
- Unit tests for App.tsx workflow state management
- Integration tests for full form submission flow
- Error handling tests for network failures and validation errors
