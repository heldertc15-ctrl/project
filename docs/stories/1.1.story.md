# Story 1.1: Project Foundation and Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a basic local folder structure with runnable "Hello World" starter applications for both the frontend and backend,
**so that** I have a solid foundation to build the AI Soccer Betting Advisor MVP upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create the complete project folder structure as defined in the architecture
2. Implement a runnable "Hello World" React frontend application
3. Implement a runnable "Hello World" FastAPI backend application
4. Both applications should start successfully with the defined development commands
5. Root package.json should be configured with workspaces and development scripts

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create root project structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create root package.json with workspace configuration
  - [x] Create apps/frontend directory structure
  - [x] Create apps/backend directory structure
- [x] Implement Hello World React frontend (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Create frontend package.json with React, TypeScript, Vite dependencies
  - [x] Create basic App.tsx with "Hello World" message

- [x] Configure development scripts (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add npm run dev script to start both applications
  - [x] Add npm run dev:frontend script
  - [x] Add npm run dev:backend script

  - [x] Test frontend starts on correct port
  - [x] Test backend starts on correct port
  - [x] Test both can run simultaneously

No previous stories - this is the foundation story.

### Project Structure
Exact file structure to create based on [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
```

└── README.md
```

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: TypeScript ~5.2.2, React ~18.2.0, Tailwind CSS ~3.3.3
- **Backend**: Python ~3.11, FastAPI ~0.103.1
- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest ~0.34.4
- **Backend Testing**: Pytest ~7.4.2
- **Prerequisites**: Node.js ~18.17.0 or higher, Python ~3.11

### Development Workflow Configuration
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- Root package.json must include workspace configuration
- Development commands:
  - `npm run dev` - starts both servers
  - `npm run dev:frontend` - starts only frontend
  - `npm run dev:backend` - starts only backend
- Frontend should use Vite for development
- Backend should use Uvicorn for development

### Component Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Frontend structure: components/ for reusable UI, features/ for feature-specific components, services/ for API calls
- State management: React's built-in useState hook
- No routing library needed - single page application

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Backend structure: api/ for routes, services/ for business logic
- Use dependency injection pattern for testability
- FastAPI application initialization in main.py

### Environment Configuration
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- Will need apps/backend/.env file for future stories (not required for Hello World)
- GEMINI_API_KEY will be needed for AI functionality in later stories

### Testing
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for this foundational story. Testing frameworks are defined (Vitest for frontend, Pytest for backend) but specific test implementation will be addressed in future stories.

## Dev Agent Record
*This section will be populated by the development agent during implementation*

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References
No debug issues encountered during implementation.

### Completion Notes List
- All acceptance criteria successfully implemented and verified
- Fixed Windows compatibility issue by using `python -m uvicorn` instead of direct `uvicorn` command in backend package.json
- CORS properly configured for frontend-backend communication
- Both applications tested individually and simultaneously
- Frontend automatically handles port conflicts (runs on available port 3000+)
- Backend runs on fixed port 8000 as configured

### File List
**Root Files:**
- package.json (workspace configuration with concurrently for dev scripts)

**Frontend Files (apps/frontend/):**
- package.json (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS dependencies)
- index.html (main HTML template)
- src/main.tsx (React entry point)
- src/App.tsx (main App component with Hello World)
- src/index.css (Tailwind CSS imports)
- vite.config.ts (Vite configuration with port 3000)
- tsconfig.json (TypeScript configuration)
- tsconfig.node.json (TypeScript node configuration)
- tailwind.config.js (Tailwind CSS configuration)

- requirements.txt (FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pytest dependencies)
- app/__init__.py (Python package initialization)
- app/main.py (FastAPI application with Hello World endpoint and CORS)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid foundational setup with appropriate technology choices and proper project structure. The developer correctly implemented all specified requirements with good attention to Windows compatibility and CORS configuration. Code quality is clean and follows established patterns.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/frontend/src/App.tsx
  - **Change**: Removed unused React import statement
  - **Why**: TypeScript compiler was failing build due to unused import (noUnusedLocals: true)
  - **How**: Modern React with JSX transform doesn't require explicit React import, improving bundle size and eliminating build errors

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Clean, readable code following React and FastAPI conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Exact match to unified-project-structure.md requirements
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Testing frameworks properly configured (Vitest for frontend, Pytest for backend)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed TypeScript build error by removing unused React import (apps/frontend/src/App.tsx)
- [x] Verified workspace configuration works correctly
- [x] Confirmed proper dependency versions match tech stack requirements
- [x] Validated CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
- [x] Tested build process produces successful output
- [ ] Consider adding basic error boundaries for React app (future enhancement)
- [ ] Consider adding API response typing (future enhancement)
- [ ] Add basic logging configuration (future enhancement)

### Security Review

CORS configuration is appropriately restrictive (localhost:3000 only). No security concerns identified in this foundational implementation. FastAPI security features are properly enabled by default.

### Performance Considerations

Build output shows appropriate bundle sizes (143KB gzipped to 46KB). Vite configuration optimized for development experience. No performance issues identified for Hello World implementation.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

**Additional Notes:**
- Windows compatibility handled excellently with `python -m uvicorn` approach
- Package.json workspace configuration properly structured
- All specified technology versions correctly implemented
- Build and development commands work as expected
- Foundation is solid for future feature development
