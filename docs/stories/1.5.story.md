# Story 1.5: Display Prediction Result

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see the AI prediction result displayed clearly with the betting suggestion and rationale, and be able to restart the process,
**so that** I can understand the recommendation and easily make another prediction if desired.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The UI displays the prediction result in a clear, readable format
2. The betting suggestion is prominently displayed with appropriate visual styling
3. The AI rationale/analysis is clearly presented to explain the reasoning
4. The selected match details (teams, risk level) are shown for context
5. A "restart" or "make another prediction" button allows the user to return to match selection
6. The UI handles the prediction result response format correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.4 established:
- Backend `/predict` endpoint fully implemented and working
- PredictionResult interface structure with betSuggestion, rationale, and riskLevel
- Complete prediction pipeline from frontend request to backend response
- App.tsx already contains basic result display implementation in the 'result' workflow step

**Current Implementation Status:** The basic prediction result display functionality already exists in App.tsx (lines 68-97), but may need enhancement for better UX and compliance with all acceptance criteria.

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**PredictionResult Interface (Response from backend):**
```typescript
interface PredictionResult {
  betSuggestion: string; // e.g., "Liverpool to win", "Over 2.5 goals"
  rationale: string; // The one-sentence explanation
  riskLevel: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High';
}
```

**Match Interface (For context display):**
```typescript
interface Match {
  id: string;
  homeTeam: string;
  awayTeam: string;
  startTime: string; // ISO 8601 format
}
```

### Frontend Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Component Structure:**
- Components should be placed in `src/components/` for reusable UI elements
- Feature-specific components go in `src/features/prediction/`
- Consider creating a `PredictionResult.tsx` component if the result display becomes complex

**State Management:**
- Use React's built-in useState for local component state
- App.tsx manages overall workflow state with currentStep, predictionResult, selectedMatch

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/components.md]
**Prediction Result View:** Displays the loading state and the final prediction result.

The current implementation in App.tsx covers this, but may benefit from:
- Enhanced visual design and typography
- Better responsive behavior
- Clearer information hierarchy
- Potential extraction into separate component for better maintainability

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**Frontend Files to Create/Modify:**
- `apps/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Enhance existing result display implementation
- `apps/frontend/src/features/prediction/PredictionResult.tsx` - Consider creating if complexity grows
- `apps/frontend/src/features/prediction/` - Potential location for extracted components
- `apps/frontend/src/components/` - For any reusable UI components needed

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Technology Stack Requirements:**
- Frontend Language: TypeScript ~5.2.2
- Frontend Framework: React ~18.2.0
- Styling: Tailwind CSS ~3.3.3
- State Management: React Hooks ~18.2.0

**Design Requirements:**
- Must be responsive and work on mobile devices
- Follow existing Tailwind CSS styling patterns from MatchSelector
- Maintain consistency with overall application design

### Core Workflows
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
The prediction result display is the final step in the core workflow:
```
Frontend->>Backend: POST /predict (with matchId, riskLevel)
Backend-->>Frontend: Return PredictionResult
Frontend-->>User: Display prediction and rationale
```

The restart functionality returns to the beginning of the workflow for match selection.

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths align with unified project structure. The basic functionality already exists in App.tsx but may need enhancement or potential component extraction for better code organization. The existing implementation follows the established patterns from previous stories.

### Testing
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Testing Framework:** Vitest ~0.34.4

**Required Test Categories:**
- Component tests for prediction result display rendering
- State management tests for restart functionality
- Responsive design tests for different screen sizes
- Integration tests for complete prediction workflow
- Error handling tests for malformed prediction data
- Accessibility tests for screen reader compatibility

**Test File Locations:**
- `apps/frontend/src/features/prediction/PredictionResult.test.tsx` (if component extracted)
- `apps/frontend/src/App.test.tsx` (for overall workflow testing)
