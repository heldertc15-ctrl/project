## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.5 established:
- Frontend uses React ~18.2.0 with TypeScript ~5.2.2
- Styling is done with Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
- Current UI already has established patterns in App.tsx and components
- Existing visual design patterns should be maintained for consistency
- All components follow React Testing Library testing patterns

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
**Current Technology Stack:**
- Framework: React 18.2.0 - All new components and theming will be built using React
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 - This will be the standard styling method for all new and modified components, to be configured for the new theming system
- Styling: Styled Components 6.1.8 - Existing components using this will be maintained, no new components should use this method
- Testing: Testing Library 13.4.0 - Will be used to write unit tests for all new theming logic

**New Technology Strategy:**
- Theme-switching functionality will be built using React's native Context API
- No new major libraries or frameworks are proposed to minimize new dependencies

### Source Tree Integration
[Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md]
**File Organization for Theming:**
```
src/
├── hooks/                  # (+) New directory for custom hooks
│   └── useTheme.js         # (+) Hook to manage theme state
├── components/
│   └── (existing components to be modified for theming)
└── (existing structure)
```

**Integration Guidelines:**
- File Naming: All new components follow PascalCase.js convention
- Folder Organization: Custom hooks will have their own `src/hooks/` directory
- Import/Export Patterns: Use absolute paths from src directory where possible

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]
**useTheme Hook Specifications:**
- Responsibility: Custom React Hook to manage application's theme, provide current theme (light or dark) and function to toggle it
- Integration Points: Will be consumed by ThemeSwitcher component (future story) and any other theme-aware components
- Technology Stack: React
- Location: `src/hooks/useTheme.js`

**Theme System Requirements:**
- Must support both light and dark modes
- Theme variables should include colors, fonts, and spacing
- Default theme must be light mode
- Theme preference should persist across browser sessions using localStorage

### Coding Standards and Integration Rules
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md]
**Critical Integration Rules:**
- Styling Consistency: All new and modified components MUST be styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes. Do not introduce any new styled-components
- Error Handling: All theme operations must include try/catch blocks to handle localStorage errors gracefully
- Code Style: Adhere to default Create React App ESLint rules for all new code

**Component Testing Requirements:**
- All new functional components and hooks must have corresponding *.test.js file
- Tests written using React Testing Library to verify correct rendering and interactions
- Co-locate test files with component files

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Testing Framework and Location:**
- Framework: React Testing Library
- Location: Test files co-located with component files
- Coverage Target: Aim for minimum 80% unit test coverage for new code

**Required Test Categories for Theming:**
- Unit tests for useTheme hook functionality (theme switching, persistence)
- Integration tests for theme application across components
- Regression tests to ensure existing functionality not broken

**Test File Locations:**
- `src/hooks/useTheme.test.js` - Unit tests for theme hook
- Update existing component test files to verify theme integration

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Testing Framework and Location:**

**Test File Locations:**
- `src/hooks/useTheme.test.js` - Unit tests for theme hook
- Update existing component test files to verify theme integration

### Project Structure Alignment
The theming system aligns with the existing project structure:
- Uses established `src/` structure
- Follows TypeScript patterns from existing components
- Maintains Tailwind CSS styling approach
- Integrates with existing React component architecture

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing components
- Cannot break current functionality during theme system implementation
- Must use React's built-in state management (no external state libraries)
- All theme variables must be accessible through standardized interface

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]
**Theme Configuration Interface:**
```typescript
interface ThemeConfig {
  colors: {
    primary: string;
    secondary: string;
    background: string;
    surface: string;
    text: string;
    // Additional color definitions for light/dark modes
  };
  fonts: {
    family: string;
    sizes: Record<string, string>;
  };
  spacing: Record<string, string>;
}

interface Theme {
  mode: 'light' | 'dark';
  config: ThemeConfig;
}
```

**Theme Hook Interface:**
```typescript
interface UseThemeReturn {
  theme: Theme;
  toggleTheme: () => void;
  setTheme: (mode: 'light' | 'dark') => void;
}
```
