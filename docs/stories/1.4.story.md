# Story 1.4: AI Prediction Engine

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the system to receive my match and risk level selection and return an AI-generated betting prediction with rationale,
**so that** I can get intelligent betting advice based on data analysis and machine learning insights.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The backend `/predict` endpoint receives POST requests with matchId and riskLevel
2. The system performs AI analysis of web data related to the selected match
3. The system generates a bet suggestion appropriate for the specified risk level
4. The system provides a clear, one-sentence rationale explaining the prediction
5. The response is returned in the expected PredictionResult format
6. The endpoint handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 established:
- Frontend prediction request functionality with PredictionRequest interface
- Expected PredictionResult response format from `/predict` endpoint
- Frontend loading states and error handling ready for backend integration
- TypeScript interfaces: `PredictionRequest { matchId: string, riskLevel: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High' }`

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**PredictionResult Interface (Required Response):**
```typescript
interface PredictionResult {
  betSuggestion: string; // e.g., "Liverpool to win", "Over 2.5 goals"
  rationale: string; // The one-sentence explanation
  riskLevel: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High';
}
```

**Match Interface (Available from previous stories):**
```typescript
interface Match {
  id: string;
  homeTeam: string;
  awayTeam: string;
  startTime: string; // ISO 8601 format
}
```

**PredictionRequest Interface (Input from frontend):**
```typescript
interface PredictionRequest {
  matchId: string;
  riskLevel: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High';
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
**POST /predict endpoint specification:**
- URL: `http://localhost:8000/predict`
- Method: POST
- Content-Type: application/json
- Request Body: PredictionRequest object
- Response: PredictionResult object (status 200)
- Error Response: Appropriate HTTP status codes with error details

**Request Schema:**
- matchId: string (must match available match.id)
- riskLevel: string enum ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']

**Response Schema:**
- betSuggestion: string (AI-generated betting recommendation)
- rationale: string (one-sentence explanation)
- riskLevel: string (echoes input risk level)

### Backend Architecture
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
**Required File Structure:**
```
backend/app/
├── api/
│   └── prediction_router.py # Defines /predict API route (MODIFY)
├── services/
│   ├── prediction_service.py # Core AI logic (CREATE)
│   ├── match_service.py # Existing from previous stories
│   └── web_scraper.py # Web scraping logic (CREATE)
└── main.py # FastAPI app initialization (MODIFY)
```

**Key Patterns:**
- Use dependency injection in API router for testability
- Separate business logic into services layer
- Keep API routes thin, delegate to services

### External APIs and Data Sources
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
**TheSportsDB API Integration:**
- Already available through match_service.py from previous stories
- Use existing match data for analysis context

**Web Scraping Requirements:**
- Implement web scraping for additional match insights and statistics
- Handle rate limiting gracefully
- Structure data for AI analysis consumption
- Focus on reliable, publicly available sports data sources
